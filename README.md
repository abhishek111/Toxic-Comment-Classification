This is Multi-Class Classification problem hosted by Jigsaw/Conversation AI on Kaggle.

<h1>OverView</h1><br>
Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.

This challenge to come up with a better model with greater efficiency to identify the positive comments and negative comments.

The labels to classify any comments into are:
toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult and identity_hate
